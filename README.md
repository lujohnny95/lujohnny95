- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Next.js (for server-side rendering and better SEO) & Redux (toolkit), useContext - just to expand my React.js knowhow.
- I'd like to learn C# (.NET) or PHP (Laravel) in the future; as well as apply testing and workflow in greater depth; also learn to build Web 3.0 apps onto certain blockchains - to build my own decentralised Web 3.0 network someday.
